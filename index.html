				In academic circles, it is a wide belief that when NDA comes to power in the states or in the center, crime against people belonging to Scheduled Castes increase. To negate this claim, I have used the crime reports published every year by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. My hypothesis is:  <span class="bold">The crimes/atrocities against Scheduled Castes(SCs) do not 'necessarily' increase under NDA regime.</span>

				Source: The visualization makes use of the <a class="anchor" href="http://ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/ciimainpage.htm" target="_blank">Crime in India</a> report published by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.

				Through the reports, I have calculated the total number of crimes in each state during last 3 years of UPA II and first 3 years of NDA. For UPA II I summed up the number of crimes in 2011, 2012 and 2013 for each state. For NDA I summed up the number of crimes in 2014, 2015 and 2016 for each state.<br>
				As an Economics student, I must state that hypothesis testing requires much more analysis than just looking at the data and interpreting the result. As this is out of the scope of this project, I will make some assumptions and interpret the data.<br>
				I used the <a class="anchor" href="https://viz.socialcops.com" target="_blank">Social Cops</a> geovisualization tool to plot all the state-wise data on the map of India

			<p>
				If we scroll through any of the state in the map, we wil see a figure which is the count of atrocities committed against SCs over the course of 3 years during the respective regime. Darker shaded states have a higher number of reported cases. <br>
				During UPA II (2011-13) the total number of crimes against SCs across all the states stood at 106782. This figure rose to 119872 in the NDA regime (2014-16). However, this increase is not big enough to compel us to reject the stated hypothesis. Moreover, this increase can be attributed to the fact that more SCs started reporting the crime because their education level also increased in the coming years.
			</p>
			<p>
				Can the data be trusted? Not sure for two reasons:
				<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
					<li>
						In northeast, the reported crimes against SCs is almost zero. This is unimaginable.
					</li>
					<li>
						These are only reported and recorded crimes. Actual figures may be higher in both the regimes. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				State-wise Analysis
			</h4>
			<p>
				We also need to note that police comes under the jurisdiction of the home ministry of the respective states. What can we comment by looking at the figures of states? The states that saw a significant increase in the crimes were Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. Of these, only Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra came under the NDA regime during 2014-2016. Moreover, of all the states which show very high figures, only Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh come under NDA regime. Note that these states have very high population as well.

				Conclusion

			<p>
				Therefore, we can say that reported crimes did increase under the NDA regime. Does this mean that the actual number of cases also increased during the NDA regime? Cant comment.
